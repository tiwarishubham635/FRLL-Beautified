**FRLL-Beautified: A Dataset of Fun Selfie Filters with Facial Attributes**

There is a need to assess the impact of filters on the performance of
face recognition systems. For this, a standard dataset should be available with
relevant filters applied. Currently, such datasets are not publicly available. Some
datasets which are available with filters applied, are very low in resolution and
thus not relevant for use. To mitigate these limitations, we aim to create a dataset
that provides a face recognition database with filters applied to them. The proposed dataset provides high-quality images with ten different filters applied to
them. These filters vary from beautification filters and AR-based filters to filters
that modify facial landmarks. The wide range of filters including occlusion and
beautification that have been applied on the selfies allow a more diverse set of
faces to be experimented and analyzed with face recognition and other biometric
systems. The dataset will contribute further to the set of facial datasets available
publicly. This will allow researchers to study the impact of filters on facial features with a common public benchmark.
